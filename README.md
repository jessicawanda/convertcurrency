To get the best bang for your U.S. dollar abroad, update your knowledge of currency exchange. According to Douglas Stallings, senior editor for Fodor's Travel, travelers need to be aware of currency exchange options abroad because of costs. "Many options carry extraordinary hidden fees, and some places are just more difficult to negotiate since they are more cash-based than the typical American is used to," Stallings says. In lieu of foreign currency exchange desks at airports and major hotels, there are more convenient and cheaper ways to exchange currency, Stallings says. While some desks advertise "no-fee" exchanges, they still build in a hefty profit by offering a high rate.
